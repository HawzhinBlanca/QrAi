## ADR-0001 — Adopt the CODYSTEM harness as the governance + gate layer
**Date:** 2026-06-30 · **Status:** Accepted

**Context.** quran-ai-platform is a polyglot monorepo (TS + Rust + Node/Python services)
with an existing strict script (`scripts/proof.sh`) but no version control, no enforced
agent operating rules, and no single "done" definition.

**Decision.** Adopt CODYSTEM: `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` operating rules, the Research → Plan →
Implement skills, deterministic `.claude` hooks (PreToolUse guard, PostToolUse fast verify,
Stop full verify), and `scripts/verify.sh` as the canonical gate. `verify.sh` runs the
infra-free core always (Rust fmt/clippy + TS typecheck + TS/Rust tests + build) and gates
the Postgres-only platform-api integration tests behind a reachable DB (skipped, never faked).
CI runs the same script, so local == CI. The repo is now under git.

**Consequences.** "Done" = `verify.sh` green AND required CI green — never agent judgment.
`scripts/proof.sh` is retained as the equivalent strictest local gate (it additionally
requires Postgres for platform-api). Follow-up: wire branch protection once a remote exists,
and optionally add a Postgres service to CI to run the DB-gated tests.
